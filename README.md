# Split Mobile Application

- The main purpose of the application is to provide communication between people of similar interests. While there are many 
applications that are based on space or especially based on this application, it aims to gain another dimension by filtering 
feature.
- One's interests can be addressed to a wide range of areas other than the profession, so it aims to look at a larger 
perspective.
- This application aims to create a new social media platform.

## Getting Started

This project is taking 3 parts. The first part is database connection, the second part is backend services (api install) and the last part is client side.


### Requirements
```
* Ionic and Cordova
  - Ionic Framework    : ionic-angular 3.9.3
  - @ionic/cli-utils: 1.9.2
  - @ionic/app-scripts : 3.2.1
  - ionic (Ionic CLI) : 3.9.2
  - Cordova CLI : 8.1.2 (cordova-lib@8.1.1) 
  - Cordova Platforms  : android 6.3.0 browser 5.0.4

* System:
  - ios-deploy : 1.9.2 
  - Node       : v10.15.1

  - OS         : macOS High Sierra

* Python : 3.7.1
  - Flask micro framework : 1.0.2
```


### Prerequisites
#### Mysql Connection (Database side)
You need to install mysql to run the project in local environment.

Go MySQL website then download [MySQL for MAC](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/)

#### Back-end Services (API)
All back-end services are written in python. At first you need to download python.

Go Python website then download [Python for MAC](https://www.python.org/downloads/mac-osx/)

We have installed python, but we need to install some packages as well. You need to go to [this link](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition#requirements) for face recognition system package.

For the remaining packages you can download the following steps to your computer with pip package manager.

```
pip install -U Flask
pip install flask-mysql
pip install passlib
pip install requests
pip install base64
```

#### Client Side (Ionic Application)

Since this application is based on node js, first you need to download nodejs [from here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

Use [this link](https://ionicframework.com/docs/installation/cli) to download the ionic framework.

And finally you need to install cordova, to get your application build. Use [this link](https://cordova.apache.org/#getstarted) to download Cordova.


## Running locally

Before you start make sure you have database, client side(ionic and cordova) and the back-end services for face recognition and other installed locally. You can find out how to do that here.

### Step 1 - Github
   * Clone this repository.
   
### Step 2 - Database Configuration
  * First and most important thing is. You need to run MySQL locally with this command;
    >  sudo /etc/init.d/mysql start

  * Dump sql file on your local database. You need to create a database which name is   "helloworld". Type in terminal console; 
    > CREATE DATABASE helloworld (dbname);

    > USE helloworld;

* Then dump helloworld.sql file in your local database with this command;
     > mysql -u username -p database_name < helloworld.sql (path to sql file)


### Step 3 - Back-end Services
   * Go to api folder and run api.py on terminal. 
    Run python3 api.py. 
    You will see the terminal console Running on http://localhost:5000. 


## Built With
